A simple application to track the course history using D3.js .

By default, only the bitcoin exchange rate relative to the dollar is displayed, but this can be changed in the code.

The program provides some choice of settings: adding columns of currency changes during the day, smoothing waves, the ability to choose the interval.

Also, if you hold down the left mouse button near the column and drag it to another column, then you will see additional information about the changes
